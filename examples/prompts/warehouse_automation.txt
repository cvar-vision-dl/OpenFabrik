Project: Warehouse Automation Object Detection

Target Environment: Industrial warehouse, distribution center, logistics facility

Objects to Detect:
- Cardboard boxes (various sizes, taped, labeled)
- Wooden pallets (standard, euro pallets)
- Plastic containers and bins
- Forklifts and pallet jacks
- Barrels and drums
- Metal shelving units
- Safety equipment (helmets, vests, signs)
- Shipping labels and barcodes
- Shrink-wrapped items

Scene Characteristics:
- Industrial lighting (overhead fluorescents, natural light from skylights)
- Concrete floors with wear marks and forklift tracks
- Metal racking systems extending to ceiling
- Narrow aisles between shelves
- Loading docks with open bay doors
- Cluttered realistic warehouse environments
- Various times of day affecting lighting

Camera Specifications:
- Warehouse security camera perspective (ceiling-mounted, 15-30 degree angle)
- Mobile robot perspective (ground level, 1-2 feet height)
- Forklift-mounted camera perspective
- Handheld device perspective (tablet, scanner)
- Standard focal lengths: 24mm, 35mm, 50mm
- Varying depth of field
- Occasional motion blur from movement

Important Considerations:
- Images must look like real warehouse photographs
- Include typical warehouse "messiness" and clutter
- Show objects partially occluded by others
- Vary lighting quality (harsh shadows, even lighting, dim areas)
- Include safety signage and floor markings
- Show different states (organized shelves vs. disorganized piles)
