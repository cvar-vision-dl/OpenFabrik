Project: Kitchen Tabletop Object Detection and Segmentation
Target Environment
Kitchen table/counter surfaces, dining areas, food preparation zones
Objects to Detect
Dishware & Utensils:

Plates (dinner plates, side plates, bowls - ceramic, porcelain, melamine)
Cups and mugs (coffee mugs, tea cups, glasses)
Cutlery (forks, knives, spoons - stainless steel, plastic)
Serving utensils (spatulas, ladles, tongs)
Cooking utensils (wooden spoons, whisks, measuring spoons)

Food Items:

Fresh fruits (apples, bananas, oranges, berries)
Fresh vegetables (tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, onions)
Bread and baked goods (loaves, rolls, croissants)
Packaged foods (cereal boxes, pasta boxes, snack bags)
Condiment bottles (ketchup, oil, vinegar, salt/pepper shakers)

Containers & Storage:

Plastic food containers (Tupperware-style, various sizes)
Glass jars and bottles
Cutting boards (wood, plastic, different sizes)
Mixing bowls (metal, glass, ceramic)
Food storage bags and wraps

Appliances & Tools:

Coffee makers and kettles
Toasters
Blenders
Kitchen scales
Timer devices
Knife blocks

Cleaning & Accessories:

Dish towels and cloths
Sponges and brushes
Paper napkins and paper towel rolls
Placemats and coasters
Trivets and pot holders

Miscellaneous:

Recipe books or tablets (for digital recipes)
Potted herbs (basil, mint, small herb pots)
Fruit bowls
Bread baskets
Wine/water carafes

Scene Characteristics
Surface Types:

Wooden tables (light oak, dark walnut, painted)
Laminate countertops (marble-look, granite-look, solid colors)
Glass tables
Tile surfaces
Stainless steel prep surfaces

Scene States:

Meal preparation: ingredients spread out, cutting boards in use, knives mid-chop
During meals: plates with food, utensils in use, glasses filled
Post-meal: dirty dishes stacked, crumbs, partial food remains
Clean/organized: neatly arranged items, fruit bowl centered
Breakfast setup: coffee mugs, toast, cereal boxes, juice
Baking scene: flour dusted, mixing bowls, measuring cups
Mixed states: combination of clean and used items

Lighting Conditions:

Natural window light (morning sun, afternoon, golden hour)
Overhead kitchen lighting (LED, fluorescent, warm incandescent)
Under-cabinet lighting
Mixed natural and artificial
Shadows from objects and people
Backlighting from windows
Evening/dim lighting scenarios

Camera Specifications
Angles & Perspectives:

Overhead/bird's eye (ceiling-mounted, 90° downward) - primary for robotic manipulation
45° angle (typical robot arm camera perspective)
Tabletop level (horizontal view across surface)
Slightly elevated (20-30° angle, human standing perspective)

Focal Lengths:

Wide angle (16-24mm) for full table coverage
Standard (35-50mm) for realistic human view
Close-up (60-85mm) for individual object detail

Depth of Field:

Shallow (f/1.8-2.8) for isolated object focus
Medium (f/4-5.6) for small groups
Deep (f/8-11) for entire tabletop in focus

Height Variations:

Low angle (30-40cm above surface)
Medium (60-80cm above surface)
High (100-150cm above surface) - typical robot camera mounting

Important Considerations
Realism Requirements:

Include realistic food stains, crumbs, and spills
Show condensation on cold glasses
Display steam from hot beverages/food
Include shadows cast by overhead lighting
Show natural wear on cutting boards and utensils
Include reflections on shiny surfaces (plates, glasses, metal)

Variability:

Organization levels: pristine → organized → lived-in → messy → very cluttered
Occlusion scenarios: items partially hidden behind others, stacked plates, overlapping utensils
Item states: empty vs. full containers, clean vs. dirty dishes, whole vs. cut food
Seasonal variations: summer fruits, winter soups, holiday table settings

Robotic Vision Specific:

Include grasping points visibility (handles, edges, flat surfaces)
Show objects from multiple angles for 3D understanding
Include scale references (common objects for size calibration)
Capture reflective and transparent objects (glasses, shiny cutlery)
Include challenging scenarios: similar colored objects on similar backgrounds
Show objects in "pickable" vs "non-pickable" states

Safety & Practical:

Include sharp objects (knives) in various orientations
Show fragile items (glasses, ceramic) that require careful handling
Display hot items (steaming mugs, pots) that need special consideration
Include wet/slippery surfaces and spills

Data Collection Tips:

Vary table sizes and shapes (round, rectangular, square)
Include different chair positions around table
Show human hands interacting with objects occasionally
Capture motion blur for moving objects (being picked up, poured)
Include partial objects at frame edges
Vary camera exposure for different lighting conditions

This specification should help generate a comprehensive training dataset for robotic vision systems operating in kitchen environments, with particular focus on object detection, segmentation, and grasp planning.
